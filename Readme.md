# Ultimate Sidebar
UltimateSidebar is a custom Rainmeter widget.
You can get Raimmeter here: https://www.rainmeter.net/

In combination with the Software "DesktopCoral" you'll be able to permanently reserve the space for the widget.
As stated by DonationCoder.com: 

> "It acts like an invisible resizeable docking bar, which can be docked to any side of your desktop.
> This invisible dock acts as a barrier to maximized applications and essentially shields this area of your desktop from other applications."
