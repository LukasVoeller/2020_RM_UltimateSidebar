In combination with the DesktopCoral Software you'll be able to permanently reserve the space for the widget. As stated by DonationCoder.com: "DesktopCoral is an unusual program designed to "reserve" some portion of your desktop which is shielded from maximized applications..

Essentially, it acts like an invisible resizeable docking bar, which can be docked to any side of your desktop. This invisible dock acts as a barrier to maximized applications and essentially shields this area of your desktop from other applications."
